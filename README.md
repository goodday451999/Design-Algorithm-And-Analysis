# Design-Algorithm-And-Analysis
Assignments of DAA432C which were assigned to Group30.

# Assignment 1:
Write an algorithm to round of a given decimal digit and plot the error/accuracy to number of decimal digit for the solution of a quadratic equation.

# Assignment 2:
Write an efficient algorithm for the following purpose. For a given value of n (n>3), generate an (n x n) matrix whose cells are filled with randomly generated digits 0,.., 9. Now, scan the matrix with a (3 x 3) mask and find out those masks (mask positions) which are similar. For this purpose, you have to first define a similarity matrix to measure the similarity between two 3 x 3 matrices. Note that, you can report a mask position by only mentioning the top-left position of the mask. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.

# Assignment 2:
Write an efficient algorithm to solve a cubic equation of the form x^3−n=0, for some input value of n, by using a repetitive algorithm. Draw a graph of accuracy/error in the answer vs. total number of repetitions. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.
